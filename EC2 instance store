AWS EC2 Instance Store

 - EC2 Instance Store is a hardware attached to the physical hardware of the EC2 instance.
 - Instance store does not persist once the instance is terminated (Ephemeral).
 - Taking the above into consideration, the instance store has the following attributes:
    1. Absolutely no latency, as it is a physical hardware drive attached to the instance, rather then a network one like EBS.
    2. All storage is lost upon termination of the instance, so backing up the data is the responsibility of the user.
    3. In case of failure, all data is lost.
    4. The instance size attrinute determines the size of the store, and consequently, the number of IOPS that can be run.
