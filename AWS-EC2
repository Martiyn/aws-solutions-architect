AWS EC2 Instances

AWS EC2 instances are virtual computing instances that are hosted on AWS servers in different regions and availability zones.
The EC2 instances can be launched with multiple different Operational Systems including:
- Windows
- Linux
- MacOS
The OS can be selected when creating the EC2 instance.
In addition to the OS, when launching an EC2 instance, you can select all the different parameters you will need for it like:
- RAM
- CPU
- Storage space (which can be either the built-in instance store or an attached store like EBS)
- Firewall rules (via Security groups)
- Network card (network speed, public IP address)
- EC2 User script (executable script, which runs on first launch)

When launching the EC2 instance, you can select its parameters from a list of such.
Example of an EC2 instance selection:

m5.2xlarge

The above can be translated as the following:

m - instance class
5 - instance generation
2xlarge - size within the instance class

The different instance types can vary depending on the workload that would need to be executed.
For workloads that require powerful computing capabilities, a Compute Optimized instance would be best.
For workloads that require fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory, a Memory Optimized instance would be best.
For workloads that require read and write access to large data sets on the local storage, a Storage Optimized instance would be best.
