AWS EC2 Instances

AWS EC2 instances are virtual computing instances that are hosted on AWS servers in different regions and availability zones.
The EC2 instances can be launched with multiple different Operational Systems including:
- Windows
- Linux
- MacOS
The OS can be selected when creating the EC2 instance.
In addition to the OS, when launching an EC2 instance, you can select all the different parameters you will need for it like:
- RAM
- CPU
- Storage space (which can be either the built-in instance store or an attached store like EBS)
- Firewall rules (via Security groups)
- Network card (network speed, public IP address)
- EC2 User script (executable script, which runs on first launch)

When launching the EC2 instance, you can select its parameters from a list of such.
Example of an EC2 instance selection:

m5.2xlarge

The above can be translated as the following:

m - instance class
5 - instance generation
2xlarge - size within the instance class

The different instance types can vary depending on the workload that would need to be executed.
For workloads that require powerful computing capabilities, a Compute Optimized instance would be best.
For workloads that require fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory, a Memory Optimized instance would be best.
For workloads that require read and write access to large data sets on the local storage, a Storage Optimized instance would be best.

Connecting to EC2 instances via SSH.

In order to be able to use the SSH utility to connect to an EC2 instance, when creating the instance, you must create a Key pair (login).
When creating the Key pair, it will generate a .pem file, which is then used to authenticate your local shell against the EC2 instance.
Depending on the OS that your machine is running, there are multiple different ways to connect to the EC2 instance via SSH.

On Linux or MacOS, when you open a terminal, you must type in the following command:
- ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@3.250.26.200
In the above command example "EC2Tutorial.pem" is the demonstration Key pair file for authentication.
"ec2-user" is the default user that is created on your EC2 instance when it is launched.
"3.250.26.200" is the public IP of the EC2 instance.
The above may throw an error that the Key pair file is unprotected.
To avoid this, the following command must be typed in:
- chmod 0400 EC2Tutorial.pem
The above command will protect the EC2Tutorial.pem file.

On Windows <10, PuTTY must be used.
On Windows 10 or above, you can use powershell to connect to the instance.
The following command must be input:
- ssh -i .\EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@3.250.26.200
NOTE: It is very important that you are in the directory that contains the "EC2Tutorial.pem" file.

IMPORTANT: The easiest way to connect to an EC2 instance is via EC2 Instance connect.
This does not require an SSH key and happens within the browser (separate tab).
