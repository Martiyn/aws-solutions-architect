Amazon EBS

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a storage mechanism for EC2 instances.
It is essentially a network drive that can be attached to an EC2 instance.
Considering it is a network drive, that means there may be latency when it is in use.
This allows the EC2 instances to persist their data even after being terminated.
EBS is bound by Availability Zones.
It can be attached to only a single EC2 instance (unless using multiple connect).
Billing for the service takes place only for the provisioned capacity.
Multiple EBS storage instances can be attached to a single EC2 instance.
EC2 instances by default have an assigned EBS store (root volume) that is set to terminate along with the instance by default.
Snapshots can be created of the EBS storage, and new EBS storages can be created from the snapshot.
Encryption of the EBS storages works in the following way:
1. Create snapshot of EBS store
2. Create new EBS store from the snapshot
3. While creating the new EBS store, select the encrypt option
EBS has multiple volume types:
1. gp1/gp2 - General purpose SSD
2. io1/io2 - High performance SSD
3. st1 - Low cost HDD
4. st2 - Lowest cost HDD
NOTE: gp1/gp2 and io1/io2 can be used as the root volume volume type when launching an EC2 instance.
