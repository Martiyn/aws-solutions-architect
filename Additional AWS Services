AWS CloudFormation

 - CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported)
 - For example:
    1. I want a security group
    2. I want two EC2 instances using this security group
    3. I want an S3 bucket
    4. I want a load balancer in front of the machines
 - The CloudFormation creates the above for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration you specify
 - Benefits of CloudFormation are:
 - Infrastructure as code:
    1. No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
    2. Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code
 - Cost:
    1. Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier, so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
    2. You can eliminate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
    3. Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreate them at 8 AM, safely
 - Productivity:
    1. Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
    2. Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
    3. Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
 - Don't re-invent the wheel:
    1. Leverage existing templates on the web!
    2. Leverage the documentation
 - Supports (almost) all AWS resources:
    1. Everything we'll see in this course is supported
    2. You can use "custom resources" for resources that are not supported
 - CloudFormation is the base of Infrastructure As Code in AWS

 - CloudFormation Stack Designer:
 - Example: WordPress CloudFormation Stack (CloudFormation creates the full stack, as well as the relationships between the components)
 - It allows you to see all the resources and their relations in a diagram
