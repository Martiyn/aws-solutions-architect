AWS CloudFormation

 - CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported)
 - For example:
    1. I want a security group
    2. I want two EC2 instances using this security group
    3. I want an S3 bucket
    4. I want a load balancer in front of the machines
 - The CloudFormation creates the above for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration you specify
 - Benefits of CloudFormation are:
 - Infrastructure as code:
    1. No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
    2. Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code
 - Cost:
    1. Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier, so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
    2. You can eliminate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
    3. Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreate them at 8 AM, safely
 - Productivity:
    1. Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
    2. Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
    3. Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
 - Don't re-invent the wheel:
    1. Leverage existing templates on the web!
    2. Leverage the documentation
 - Supports (almost) all AWS resources:
    1. Everything we'll see in this course is supported
    2. You can use "custom resources" for resources that are not supported
 - CloudFormation is the base of Infrastructure As Code in AWS

 - CloudFormation Stack Designer:
 - Example: WordPress CloudFormation Stack (CloudFormation creates the full stack, as well as the relationships between the components)
 - It allows you to see all the resources and their relations in a diagram

System Manager - SSM Session Manager

 - Allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 and on-prem servers
 - No SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys needed
 - No port 22 needed (better security)
 - Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows
 - Send session log data to S3 or CloudWatch Logs
 - You need to create an IAM Role for the EC2 instance, which allows SSM access to it

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Systems Manager - Other Services

 - Systems Manager - Run Command:
 - Execute a document (=script) or just run a command
 - Run command across multiple instances (using resource groups)
 - No need for SSH
 - Command Output can be shown in the AWS Console, sent to S3 bucket or CloudWatch Logs
 - Send notifications to SNS about command status (In progress, Success, Failed, ..)
 - Integrated with IAM & CloudTrail
 - Can be invoked using EventBridge

 - Systems Manager - Patch Manager:
 - Automates the process of patching managed instances
 - OS updates, applications updates, security updates
 - Supports EC2 instances and on-prem servers
 - Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows
 - Patch on-demand or on a schedule using Maintenance Windows
 - Scan instances and generate patch compliance report (missing patches)

 - Systems Manager - Maintenance Windows:
 - Defines a schedule for when to perform actions on your instances
 - Example: OS patching, updating drivers, installing software, ...
 - Maintenance Window contains:
    1. Schedule
    2. Duration
    3. Set of registered instances
    4. Set of registered tasks

 - Systems Manager - Automation:
 - Simplifies common maintenance and deployment tasks of EC2 instances and other AWS resources
 - Examples: restart instances, create an AMI, EBS snapshot
 - Automation Runbook - SSM Documents to define actions performed on your EC2 instances or AWS resources (pre-defined or custom)
 - Can be triggered using:
    1. Manually using AWS Console, AWS CLI or SDK
    2. Amazon EventBridge
    3. On a schedule using Maintenance Windows
    4. By AWS Config for rules remediations

AWS Cost Explorer

 - Used to Visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time
 - Create custom reports that analyze cost and usage data
 - Analyze your data at a high level: total costs and usage across all accounts
 - Or Monthly, hourly, resource level granularity
 - Choose an optimal Savings Plan (to lower prices on your bill)
 - Forecast usage up to 12 months based on previous usage

AWS Batch

 - Fully managed batch processing at any scale
 - Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on AWS
 - A "batch" job is a job with a start and an end (opposed to continuous)
 - Batch will dynamically launch EC2 instances or Spot Instances
 - AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute / memory
 - You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch does the rest!
 - Batch jobs are defined as Docker Images and run on ECS
 - Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure
 - Unlike Lambda, Batch:
    1. Has no time limit
    2. Can support any runtime as long as it's packaged as a Docker image
    3. Relies on EBS / Instance store for disk space
    4. Relies on EC2 (can be managed by AWS)
