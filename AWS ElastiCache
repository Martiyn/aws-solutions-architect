AWS ElastiCache

 - ElastiCache is used to get managed Redis or Memcached (same way that RDS is for managed relational DBs).
 - Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance and low latency
 - Helps reduce load off databases for read-intensive workloads
 - Helps make your app stateless
 - AWS takes care of OS maintenance, patching, optimizations, setup, config., monitoring, failure recovery and backups.
 - ElastiCache requires heavy application code changes in order to be used (app must be configured to query the cache).
 - ElastiCache solution architecture can be viewed as the following (DB Cache):
    1. Application queries ElastiCache, if data is not available in the cache, it is fetched from RDS and stored in the cache.
    2. Cache must have an invalidation strategy to ensure only the most current data is used
 - ElastiCache solution architecture can be viewed as the following (User Session Store):
    1. User logs into the application
    2. Application writes the session data into ElastiCache
    3. If the user gets on another app instance, the session data can be fetched from the cache
 - Elasticache - Redis vs Memcached:
    1. Redis:
       - Multi-AZ with Auto-Failover
       - Read Replicas to scale reads and have high availability
       - Data durability using AOF persistence
       - Backup & restore features
       - Supports sets and sorted sets
    2. Memcached
       - Multi-node for partitioning of data (sharding)
       - No high availability (no replication)
       - Non-persistent
       - No backup and restore
       - Multi-threaded architecture

 - ElastiCache has security features:
    1. Supports IAM Auth (Redis only)
    2. IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security
    3. Redis AUTH:
       - You can set a "pw/token" when creating the Redis cluster
       - This is an extra level of security for your cache
       - Support SSL in-flight encryption
    4. Memcached supports SASL-based auth

 - ElastiCache data loading patterns:
    1. Lazy loading (all the read data is cached, data can become stale in cache)
    2. Write through (Add or update data in the cache when written to DB)
    3. Session store (store temporary session data in a cache)

 - Use cases for Redis are:
    1. Gaming leaderbords (computationally complex)
    2. Redis sorted sets guarantee both uniqueness and element ordering
    3. Each time a new element is added, it is ranked in real time, then added in correct order
