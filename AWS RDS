AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)

 - AWS RDS is a managed database service for database use with SQL as the query lanquage
 - RDS allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
 - Supported DB engines are:
   1. Postgres
   2. MySQL
   3. MariaDB
   4. Oracle
   5. Microsoft SQL server
   6. Aurora (AWS proprietary DB)
 - Why it is recommended to use RDS instead of hosting a DB on an EC2 instance:
   1. Automated provisioning and OS patching
   2. Continuous backup and restore to specific timestamps
   3. Monitoring dashboards
   4. Read replicas for improved performance
   5. Multi AZ setup for Disaster Recovery
   6. Maintenance windows for upgrades
   7. Scaling capability (both vertical and horizontal)
   8. Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
 - NOTE: you cannot SSH to the RDS instances.
 - RDS automatically detects when your DB is running out of storage and auto scales it.
 - It is not recommended to manually scale your DB.
 - A maximum DB storage threshold must be set.

RDS Read replicas for read scalability

 - Read replicas help you scale your database READS.
 - You can have up to 15 read replicas.
 - Read replicas can be within AZ, cross AZ or cross region.
 - Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent (progressively updated).
 - Replicas can be promoted to become their own Database.
 - Applications must update their connection string in order to leverage read replicas.
 - Read replicas can be created to run separate workloads on the same Database (in order to not overload the Database).
 - Read replicas can only be used for SELECT (read) statements so that no DB manipulation can occur (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE).
 - RDS has a cost when transferring data from one AZ to another.
 - Read replicas in the same region do not have a fee.
 - Read replicas transferred between regions have a fee.
