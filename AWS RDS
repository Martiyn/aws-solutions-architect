AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)

 - AWS RDS is a managed database service for database use with SQL as the query lanquage
 - RDS allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
 - Supported DB engines are:
   1. Postgres
   2. MySQL
   3. MariaDB
   4. Oracle
   5. Microsoft SQL server
   6. Aurora (AWS proprietary DB)
 - Why it is recommended to use RDS instead of hosting a DB on an EC2 instance:
   1. Automated provisioning and OS patching
   2. Continuous backup and restore to specific timestamps
   3. Monitoring dashboards
   4. Read replicas for improved performance
   5. Multi AZ setup for Disaster Recovery
   6. Maintenance windows for upgrades
   7. Scaling capability (both vertical and horizontal)
   8. Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
 - NOTE: you cannot SSH to the RDS instances.
 - RDS automatically detects when your DB is running out of storage and auto scales it.
 - It is not recommended to manually scale your DB.
 - A maximum DB storage threshold must be set.
