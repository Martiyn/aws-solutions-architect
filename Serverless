Introduction to Serverless

 - Serverless is a new paradign in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore
 - They just deploy code (functions)
 - Initially Serverless == FaaS (Function as a Service)
 - Serverless was poineered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that is not managed by the user:
    1. Databases
    2. Storage
    3. Messaging
    4. etc...
 - Serverless does not mean that there are no servers, it means you don't manage and provision/see them

 - Serverless in AWS:
 - We have our users, that for example, would get static content from our S3 bucket (delivered as a website)
 - Then, we would login with Amazon Cognito, where our users would have their identity stored
 - This would invoke your REST API via Amazon API Gateway
 - The API Gateway would invoke your Lambda functions
 - The Lambda functions would invoke your DynamoDB

 - Serverless services in AWS are:
    1. AWS Lambda
    2. DynamoDB
    3. AWS Cognito
    4. AWS API Gateway
    5. Amazon S3
    6. SNS & SQS
    7. Kinesis Data Firehose
    8. Aurora Serverless
    9. Step Functions
    10. Fargate
