Disaster Recovery in AWS

 - Any event that has a negative impact on a company's business continuity or finances is a disaster
 - Disaster Recovery (DR) is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster
 - What kind of disaster recovery?:
    1. On-premise => On-premise - traditional DR, very expensive
    2. On-premise => AWS Cloud - hybrid recovery
    3. AWS Cloud Region A => AWS Cloud Region B - cloud recovery
 - Need to define two terms:
    1. RPO: Recovery Point Objective
    2. RTO: Recovery Time Objective

 - RPO and RTO:
 - RPO is the points in time that you make backups of your data, time between the RPO and the disaster is a data loss (as all updates since last recovery point have been lost)
 - RTO is the amount of downtime that the application has after experiencing a disaster

 - Disaster Recovery Strategies:
 - Backup and Restore
 - Pilot Light
 - Warm Standby
 - Hot Site / Multi Site Approach

 - In terms of RTO speed, they are as follows:

   ---------------------(Faster RTO)-------------------------->

    Backup & Restore, Pilot Light, Warm Standby, Multi Site

 - The faster the RTO, the higher the cost

 - Backup and Restore (High RPO):
    1. It is very cheap (pay only for the storage of the snapshots)
    2. Has high RPO (can make snapshots often), but low RTO
 - Pilot light:
    1. A small version of the app is always running in the cloud
    2. Useful for the critical core (pilot light)
    3. Very similar to Backup & Restore
    4. Faster than Backup and Restore as critical systems are already up
 - Warm standby:
    1. Full system is up and running, but at minimum size
    2. Upon disaster, we can scale to production load
 - Multi Site / Hot Site Approach:
    1. Very low RTO (minutes or seconds) - very expensive
    2. Full Production Scale is running on AWS and On-prem

 - Disaster Recovery Tips:
 - Backup:
    1. EBS Snapshots, RDS automated backups / Snapshots, etc..
    2. Regular pushes to S3 / S3 IA / Glacier, Lifecycle Policy, Cross Region Replication
    3. From On-Premise: Snowball or Storage Gateway
 - High Availability:
    1. Use Route53 to migrate DNS over from Region to Region
    2. RDS Multi-AZ, ElastiCache Multi-AZ, EFS, S3
    3. Site to Site VPN as a recovery from Direct Connect
 - Replication:
    1. RDS Replication (Cross Region), AWS Aurora + Global Databases
    2. Database replication from on-premise to RDS
    3. Storage Gateway
 - Automation:
    1. CloudFormation / Elastic Beanstalk to re-create a whole new environment
    2. Recover / Reboot EC2 instances with CloudWatch if alarms fail
    3. AWS Lambda functions for customized automations
 - Chaos:
    1. Netflix has a "simian-army" randomly terminating EC2
    2. This essentially testing on Production to ensure that the infrastructure is viable

DMS - Database Migration Service

 - Quickly and securely migrate databases to AWS, resilient, self-healing
 - The source database remains available during the migration
 - Supports:
    1. Homogenous migrations: ex Oracle to Oracle
    2. Heterogeneous migrations: ex Microsoft SQL Server to Aurora
 - Continuous Data Replication using CDC
 - You must create an EC2 instance to perform the replication tasks

 - DMS Sources and Targets
 - Sources:
    1. On-prem and EC2 instances databases:
       - Oracle
       - MS SQL Server
       - MySQL
       - MariaDB
       - PostgreSQL
       - MongoDB
       - SAP
       - DB2
    2. Azure: Azure SQL Database
    3. Amazon RDS: all including Aurora
    4. Amazon S3
    5. DocumentDB
- Targets:
   1. On-Premises and EC2 instances databases:
      - Oracle
      - MS SQL Server
      - MySQL
      - MariaDB
      - PostgreSQL
      - SAP
   2. Amazon RDS
   3. Redshift, DynamoDB, S3
   4. OpenSearch Service
   5. Kinesis Data Streams
   6. Apache Kafka
   7. DocumentDB & Amazon Neptune
   8. Redis & Babelfish

 - AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT):
 - Convert you Database's Schema from one engine to another
 - Example OLTP: (SQL Server or Oracle) to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora
 - Example OLAP: (Teradata or Oracle) to Amazon Redshift
 - You do not need to use SCT if you are migrating the same DB engine
    1. Ex: On-Premise PostgreSQL => RDS PostgreSQL
    2. The DB engine is still PostgreSQL (RDS is the platform)
