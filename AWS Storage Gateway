Hybrid Cloud for Storage

 - AWS is pushing for "hybrid cloud":
    1. Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
    2. Part of your infrastructure is also on-premises
 - This can be due to:
    1. Long cloud migrations
    2. Security requirements
    3. Compliance requirements
    4. IT strategy

 - S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS)
 - So how do you expose the S3 data on-premises?
 - With AWS Storage Gateway!

 - AWS Storage Cloud Native options:
    1. Block level storage:
       - Amazon EBS
       - EC2 instance store
    2. File level storage:
       - Amazon EFS
       - Amazon FSx
    3. Object level storage:
       - Amazon S3
       - Amazon Glacier

 - AWS Storage Gateway:
 - Acts as a bridge between on-premises data and cloud data
 - Use cases:
    1. disaster recovery
    2. backup & restore
    3. tiered storage
    4. on-premises cache & low latency file access
 - Types of Storage Gateway:
    1. S3 File Gateway
       - Configured S3 buckets are accessible using the NFS and SMB protocol
       - Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway
       - Supports S3 Standard, S3 Standard IA, S3 OneZone A, S3 Intelligent Tiering
       - Transition to S3 Glacier using a Lifecycle Policy
       - Bucket access using IAM roles for each File Gateway
       - SMB protocol has integration with Active Directory for user auth
    2. FSx File Gateway
       - Native access to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
       - Local cache for frequently accessed data
       - Windows native compatibility (SMB, NTFS, Active Directory...)
       - Useful for group file shares and home directories
    3. Volume Gateway
       - Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3
       - Volume backed up by EBS snapshots, which can help restore on-prem volumes
       - Cached volumes: low latency access to most recent data
       - Stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3
    4. Tape Gateway
       - Some ocmpanies have backup processes using real physical tapes
       - With Tape Gateway, companies use the same processes, but in the cloud
       - Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier
       - Back up data using existing tape-based processes (and iSCSI interface)
       - Works with leading backup software vendors

 - Storage Gateway - Hardware appliance:
 - Using Storage Gateway means you need on-prem virtualization
 - Otherwise, you can use a Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance
 - Works with File Gateway, Volume Gateway, Tape Gateway
 - Has the required CPU, memory, network, SSD cache resources
 - NOTE: This is a device that needs to be physically installed
