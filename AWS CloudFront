AWS CloudFront

 - Cloudfront is a Content delivery network (CDN)
 - Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
 - Improves user experience by lowering latency
 - 216 points of presence (edge locations)
 - DDoS protection (because it is worldwide)
 - Integration with Shield and AWS Web Application Firewall


 - Cloudfront - Origins:
    1. S3 bucket:
       - For distributing files and caching them at the edge location
       - Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
       - OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)
       - CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
    2. Custom Origin (HTTP):
       - Application load balancer
       - EC2 instance
       - S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
       - Any HTTP backend you want


- How CloudFront works:
    1. Content from an S3 bucket(origin) is sent to the Edge location and cached
    2. A request is made to retrieve content from an S3 bucket
    3. The request is routed to the edge location (as it is closer, thus reducing latency)
    4. If the content is not in the cache, then it is fetched from the S3 bucket 

 - CoudFront vs S3 Cross-region replication:
    1. CloudFront:
       - Global Edge network
       - Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
       - Great for static content that must be available everywhere
    2. Cross region replication:
       - Must be setup for each region in which you want replication to happen
       - Files are updated in ner real-time (no caching)
       - Read only
       - Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions


 - CloudFront - ALB or EC2 as an origin:
    1. EC2:
       - EC2 must be configured to allow the public IP of the Edge locations
       - Configuration works via EC2 Security groups (set to allow the IP)
       - EC2 instance must be public
    2. ALB:
       - ALB must be public
       - EC2 instances behind the ALB can be private, as the ALB can connect to private resources
       - ALB must be configured to allow the public IP of the Edge locations
       - Configuration works via ALB Security groups (set to allow the IP)
