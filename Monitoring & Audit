CloudWatch Metrics

 - CloudWatch provides metrics for every AWS service
 - Metric is a variable to monitor (CPU util, Networking, etc..)
 - Metrics belong to namespaces
 - Dimension is an attribute of a metric (instance id, environment, etc..)
 - Up to 30 dimensions per metric
 - Metrics have timestamps
 - Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics
 - Can create CloudWatch Custom Metrics (e.g., for the RAM)

 - CloudWatch Metric Streams:
 - Continually stream CloudWatch metrics to a destination of your choice with near-real-time delivery and low latency
    1. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose (and then its destinations)
    2. 3rd party service provider: Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Splunk, Sumo logic, etc..

   CloudWatch Metrics ---(stream near-real-time)---> Kinesis Data Firehose ------> Amazon S3 ------> Athena 

 - The data is stored in Amazon S3 and can then be analyzed with Athena
 - You can alternatively store your data in Amazon Redshift (data warehouse) - from Firehose
 - You can also route the data from Firehose to Amazon OpenSearch to perform analytics there
 - Option to filter metrics to only stream a subset of them
