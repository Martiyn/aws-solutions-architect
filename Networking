CIDR - IPv4

 - Classless Inter-Domain Routing - a method for allocating IP addresses
 - CIDRs help to define an IP address range:
    1. We've seen 11.22.33.44.55/32 => one IP
    2. We've seen 0.0.0.0/0 => all IPs
    3. But we can define: 192.168.0.0/26 => 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.63 (64 IP address range)
 - A CIDR has two components:
    1. Base IP:
       - Represents an IP contained in the range (XX.XX.XX.XX)
       - Example: 10.0.0.0 or 192.168.0.0
    2. Subnet Mask:
       - Defines how many bits can change in the IP
       - Example /0 or /24 or /32
       - Can take two forms:
          1. /8 <=> 255.0.0.0
          2. /16 <=> 255.255.0.0
          3. /24 <=> 255.255.255.0
          4. /32 <=> 255.255.255.255

 - CIDR - Subnet Mask:
 - The Subnet Mask basically allows part of the underlying IP to get additional next values from the base IP

   192.168.0.0/32 => allows for 1 IP (2^0) ------> 192.168.0.0
   192.168.0.0/31 => allows for 2 IP (2^1) ------> 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.1
   192.168.0.0/30 => allows for 4 IP (2^2) ------> 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.3
   192.168.0.0/29 => allows for 8 IP (2^3) ------> 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.7
   192.168.0.0/28 => allows for 16 IP (2^4) ------> 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.15
   192.168.0.0/27 => allows for 32 IP (2^5) ------> 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.31
   192.168.0.0/26 => allows for 64 IP (2^6) ------> 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.63
   192.168.0.0/25 => allows for 128 IP (2^7) ------> 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.127
   192.168.0.0/24 => allows for 256 IP (2^8) ------> 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.0.255
   192.168.0.0/16 => allows for 65,536 IP (2^16) ------> 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.255.255
   192.168.0.0/0 => allows for All IPs ------> 0.0.0.0 -> 255.255.255.255

 - IPs are made of four Octets:

   123.456.789.0
   (1).(2).(3).(4)

 - /32 - no octet can change
 - /24 - last octet can change
 - /16 - last two octets can change
 - /8 - last 3 octets can change
 - /0 - all octets can change

 - Public vs. Private IP (IPv4):
 - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) established certain blocks of IPv4 addresses for the use of private (LAN) and public (Internet) addresses
 - Private IP can only allow certain values:
    1. 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) - in big networks
    2. 172.16.0.0 - 172.16.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12) - AWS default VPC in that range
    3. 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) - e.g. home networks

 - All the rest of the IP addresses on the Internet are Public

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AWS VPC

 - VPC = Virtual Private Cloud
 - AWS Default VPC:
 - All new AWS accounts have a default VPC
 - New EC2 instances are launched into the default VPC if no subnet is specified
 - Default VPC has internet connectivity and all EC2 instances inside it have public IPv4 addresses
 - We also get a public and a private IPv4 DNS names


 - User created VPC in AWS:
 - You can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region (max. 5 per region - soft limit)
 - Max. CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR:
    1. Min. size is /28 (16 IP addresses)
    2. Max. size is /16 (65536 IP addresses)
 - Because VPC is private, only the Private IPv4 ranges are allowed:
    1. 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
    2. 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
    3. 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)

 - Your VPC CIDR should NOT overlap with your other networks (e.g. corporate)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VPC Subnet

 - AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet
 - These 5 IP addresses are not available for use and can't be assigned to an EC2 instance
 - Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are:
    1. 10.0.0.0 -  Network Address
    2. 10.0.0.1 - reserved by AWS for the VPC router
    3. 10.0.0.2 - reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
    4. 10.0.0.3 - reserved by AWS for future use
    5. 10.0.0.255 - Network Broadcast Address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore the address is reserved

 - Exam Tip:
 - If you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances (5 addresses are always reserved):
    1. You can't choose a subnet of size /27 (32 IP addresses, 32-5=27<29)
    2. You need to choose a subnet size /26 (64 IP addresses, 64-5=59>29)

Internet Gateway (IGW)

 - Allows resources (e.g., EC2 instances) in a VPC to connect to the Internet
 - It scales horizontally and is highly available and redundant
 - Must be created separately from a VPC
 - One VPC can have only one IGW attached and vice versa
 - Internet Gateways on their own do not allow internet access..
 - Route tables must also be edited!
 - Diagram:

   Internet <---(www)---> Internet Gateway <------> Router <------> EC2 instance (public)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bastion Hosts

 - A Bastion Host is an EC2 instance that lives within the Public Subnet
 - We can use Bastion Host to SSH into our private EC2 instances (in Private Subnet)
 - The bastion is in the public subnet, which is then connected to all other private subnets
 - Bastion Host security group must allow inbound from the Internet on port 22 from restricted CIDR, for example, the public CIDR of your corporation
 - Security Group of the EC2 Instances must allow the Security Group of the Bastion Host, or the private IP of the Bastion host
 - Diagram:

   Users ---(SSH)---> EC2 Bastion Host ---(SSH)---> Private EC2 instance/s

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAT Instance (outdated, but still in the exam)

 - NAT = Network Address Translation
 - Allows EC2 instance in private subnets to connect to the Internet
 - Must be launched in a public subnet
 - Must disable EC2 setting: Source / destination Check
 - Must have Elastic IP attached to it
 - Route Tables must be configured to route traffic from private subnets to the NAT Instance
 - NAT instances re-write packets that are being sent within the VPC
 - They change the source and destination IP addresses of the sent packets
 - When a packet is sent from a private instance, its source IP is the private instance IP
 - Once the NAT instance re-writes the packet, its source IP is changed to be the NAT instance IP
 - The destination IP is that of the Server
 - When a response from the server is returned, the destination is the NAT instance IP
 - The NAT instance then changes the destination IP to the private IP of the private EC2 instance
 - NOTE: You must stop source / destination checking, as a NAT instance must be able to send and receive traffic when the source or destination is not itself

 - NAT Instance - Comments:
 - Pre-configured Amazon Linux AMI is available
    1. Reached the end of standard support on Dec. 31, 2020
 - Not highly available / resilient setup out of the box
    1. You need to create an ASG in multi-AZ + resilient user-data script
 - Internet traffic bandwidth depends on EC2 instance type
 - You must manage Security Groups & rules:
    1. Inbound:
       - Allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic coming from Private Subnets
       - Allow SSH from your home network (access is provided through Internet Gateway)
    2. Outbound:
       - Allow HTTP / HTTPS traffic to the Internet

NAT Gateway

 - AWS-managed NAT, higher bandwidth, high availability, no administration
 - Pay per hour for usage and bandwidth
 - NATGW is created in a specific AZ, uses an Elastic IP
 - Can't be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from other subnets)
 - Requires an IGW (Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW)
 - 5 Gbps of bandwidth with automatic scaling up to 100 Gbps
 - No Security Groups to manage / required
 - Diagram:

   Internet <---(www)---> Internet Gateway <------> Router <------> NAT Gateway <------> Private EC2 instance

 - In the above, the NAT Gateway lives in the public subnet, while the private EC2 instance lives in the private subnet

 - NAT Gateway with High Availability:
 - NAT Gateway is resilient within a single AZ
 - Must create multiple NAT Gateways in multiple AZs for fault-tolerance
 - There is no cross-AZ failover needed because if an AZ goes down, it doesn't need NAT

 - NAT Gateway vs. NAT Instance:
 - NAT Gateway:
    1. Availability - Highly available within AZ (create in another AZ)
    2. Bandwidth - Up to 100 Gbps
    3. Maintenance - Managed by AWS
    4. Cost - Per hour & amount of data transferred
    5. Public IPv4 - Yes
    6. Private IPv4 - Yes
    7. Security Groups - No
    8. Use as Bastion Host? - No
 - NAT Instance:
    1. Availability - Use a script to manage failover between instances
    2. Bandwidth - Depends on EC2 instance type
    3. Maintenance - Managed by you (software, OS pathces, etc..)
    4. Cost - Per hour, EC2 instance type and size + network $
    5. Public IPv4 - Yes
    6. Private IPv4 - Yes
    7. Security Groups - Yes
    8. Use as Bastion Host? - Yes
