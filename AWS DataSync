AWS DataSync

 - Move large amount of data to and from places
 - Places could be: On-premises / other cloud to AWS (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3 API, ...) - needs agent
 - AWS to AWS migrations are also possible (different storage services) - no agent needed
 - Can synchronize to:
    1. Amazon S3 (any storage classes, including Glacier)
    2. Amazon EFS
    3. Amazon FSx (Windows, Lustre, NetApp, OpenZFS, ...)
 - Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly
 - File permissions and metadata are preserved (NFS POSIX, SMB, ...)
 - One agent task can use 10 Gbps, can setup bandwidth limit
