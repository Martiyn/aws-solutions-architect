Encryption 101 (Overview)

 - What is encryption?

 - Encryption in flight (TLS/SSL)
 - Data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving
 - TLS certificates help using encryption (HTTPS)
 - Encryption in flight ensures no MITM (man in the middle attack) can happen
 - Diagram

   Client ---(username and password)---> TLS Encryption ------> TLS Decryption ---(username and password)---> HTTPS Website

 - Server-side encryption at rest
 - Data is encrypted after being received by the server
 - Data is decrypted before being sent
 - Data is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually data key)
 - The encryption/decryption keys must be managed somewhere, and the server must have access to that location
 - Diagram:

   Object ---(HTTP(S))---> Object + Data Key = Encryption ------> Enctypted object + Data key = Decryption ---(HTTP(S))---> Object

 - Everything between the objects is the server!

 - Client-side encryption
 - Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server
 - Data will be decrypted by a receiving client
 - The server should not be able to decrypt the data
 - Could leverage Envelope Encryption
 - Diagram:

   Object + Data key (client-side) ---(encryption)---> Encrypted object ---(store)---> Storage service(FTP, S3, ...)

   Storage service(FTP, S3, ...) ---(retrieve)---> Encrypted object + Data key ---(Decryption)---> Decrypted object

 - Encryption is completely handled client-side
 - No decryption or encryption occurs on the storage service
