What is DNS

 - Domain Name System, which translates the human friendly hostnames into the machine IP addresses
 - www.google.com => 172.217.18.36
 - DNS is the backbone of the internet
 - DNS uses hierarchical naming structure
    1. .com
    2. example.com
    3. www.example.com
    4. api.example.com

 - Domain Registrar (domain registry services): Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy, ...
 - DNS Records: A, AAAA, CNAME, NS, ...
 - Zone File: contains DNS records (matches hostnames to IP addresses)
 - Name server: resolves DNS queries (Authorative or Non-Authorative)
 - Top level domain (TLD): .com, .us, .gov, .org, ...
 - Second level domain (SLD): google.com, amazon.com, ...
 - Example URL for demonstration purposes:

                http://api.www.example.com

 - "." is called the root of the URL
 - ".com." is called the top level domain (TLD)
 - ".example.com." is called the second level domain (SLD)
 - ".www.example.com." is called the Sub domain
 - "api.www.example.com" is called the Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
 - "http" is called the protocol
 - "http://api.www.example.com" is called the URL

 - How DNS works:

 Web Browser --> Local DNS Server --> Root DNS Server --> Local DNS Server --> TLD DNS Server --> Local DNS Server --> SLD DNS Server --> Local DNS Server --> Web Browser --> Web Server

     1. The web browser makes a query to the local DNS server (managed by your company or ISP)
     2. The local DNS server makes a query to the root DNS server (managed by ICANN)
     3. The root DNS server returns a response to the local DNS server
     4. The local DNS server then queries the TLD DNS server (managed by IANA)
     5. The TLD DNS server returns a response to the local DNS server
     6. The local DNS server then queries the SLD DNS server (managed by a domain registrar)
     7. The SLD DNS server returns a response to the local DNS server
     8. The local DNS server returns the IP address of the URL to the browser
     9. The browser uses the IP address to access the web server (example.com)

Amazon Route 53

 - Route 53 is a highly available, scalable, fully managed and Authoritative DNS
    1. Authoritative = the customer is able to update the DNS records

 - Route 53 is also a Domain Registrar
 - Route 53 has the ability to check the health of network resources
 - Route 53 is the only AWS service, which provides 100% availability SLA
 - The name Route 53 is a reference to the traditional DNS port used by DNS services
 - Route 53 records allow you to decide how you want to route traffic for a domain
 - Each record contains the following:
    1. Domain/subdomain name - e.g., example.com
    2. Record type - e.g., A or AAAA
    3. Value - e.g., 12.34.56.78
    4. Routing policy - how Route 53 responds to queries
    5. TTL (time to live) - amount of time the record cached at DNS resolvers

 - Route 53 supports the following DNS record types:
    1. A / AAAA / CNAME / NS (must know)
    2. CAA / DS / MX / NAPTR / PTR / SOA / TXT / SPF / SRV (advanced)

 - Record types:
    1. A - maps a hostname to IPv4
    2. AAAA - maps a hostname to IPv6
    3. CNAME - maps a hostname to another hostname:
       - The target is a domain name, which must have an A or AAAA record
       - Can't create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)
       - Example of the above: you can't create for example.com, but you can create for www.example.com
    4. NS - Name servers for the Hosted Zone (Control how traffic is routed for a domain)
