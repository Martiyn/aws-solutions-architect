What is DNS

 - Domain Name System, which translates the human friendly hostnames into the machine IP addresses
 - www.google.com => 172.217.18.36
 - DNS is the backbone of the internet
 - DNS uses hierarchical naming structure
    1. .com
    2. example.com
    3. www.example.com
    4. api.example.com

 - Domain Registrar (domain registry services): Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy, ...
 - DNS Records: A, AAAA, CNAME, NS, ...
 - Zone File: contains DNS records (matches hostnames to IP addresses)
 - Name server: resolves DNS queries (Authorative or Non-Authorative)
 - Top level domain (TLD): .com, .us, .gov, .org, ...
 - Second level domain (SLD): google.com, amazon.com, ...
 - Example URL for demonstration purposes:

                http://api.www.example.com

 - "." is called the root of the URL
 - ".com." is called the top level domain (TLD)
 - ".example.com." is called the second level domain (SLD)
 - ".www.example.com." is called the Sub domain
 - "api.www.example.com" is called the Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
 - "http" is called the protocol
 - "http://api.www.example.com" is called the URL

 - How DNS works:

 Web Browser --> Local DNS Server --> Root DNS Server --> Local DNS Server --> TLD DNS Server --> Local DNS Server --> SLD DNS Server --> Local DNS Server --> Web Browser --> Web Server

     1. The web browser makes a query to the local DNS server (managed by your company or ISP)
     2. The local DNS server makes a query to the root DNS server (managed by ICANN)
     3. The root DNS server returns a response to the local DNS server
     4. The local DNS server then queries the TLD DNS server (managed by IANA)
     5. The TLD DNS server returns a response to the local DNS server
     6. The local DNS server then queries the SLD DNS server (managed by a domain registrar)
     7. The SLD DNS server returns a response to the local DNS server
     8. The local DNS server returns the IP address of the URL to the browser
     9. The browser uses the IP address to access the web server (example.com)
