AWS FSx

 - Allows you to launch 3rd party high-performance file systems on AWS
 - Fully managed service
 - FSx is the cloud solution to launching file systems in the cloud (like RDS does for databases)
 - You can launch FSx for example:
    1. Lustre
    2. Windows File Server
    3. NetApp ONTAP
    4. Open ZFS

 - FSx for Windows File server:
 - Fully managed Windows file system shared drive
 - Supports SMB protocol & Windows NTFS
 - MS Active Directory integration, ACLs, user quotas
 - Can be mounted on Linux EC2 instances
 - Supports MS Distributet File System (DFS) Namespaces (group files across multiple FS)
 - Performance scales up to 10s GB/s, millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data
 - Storage options are:
    1. SSD - latency sensitive workloads (databases, media processing, data analytics, ...)
    2. HDD - broad spectrum of workloads (home directory, CMS, ...)
 - Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastructure (VPN or Direct Connect)
 - Can be configured to be Multi-AZ for high availability
 - Data is backed-up daily to S3

 - FSx for Lustre:
 - Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, for large scale computing
 - The name Lustre comes from "Linux" and "cluster"
 - Machine Learning, High Performance Computing (HPC)
 - Video processing, financial modeling, electronic design automation
 - Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IPS, sub-ms latencies
 - Storage options:
    1. SSD - low latency, IOPS intensive workloads, small & random file operations
    2. HDD - throughput-intensive workloads, large & sequential file operations
 - Seamless integration with S3:
    1. Can "read S3" as a file system (through FSx)
    2. Can write the output of the computations back to S3 (through FSx)
 - Can be used from on-prem servers (VPN or Direct Connect)

 - Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP:
 - Managed NetApp ONTAP on AWS
 - File System compatible with NFS, SMB, iSCSI protocol
 - Move workloads running on ONTAP or NAS to AWS
 - Works with:
    1. Linux
    2. Windows
    3. MacOS
    4. VMware cloud on AWS
    5. Amazon Workspaces & AppStream 2.0
    6. Amazon EC2, ECS and EKS
 - Storage shrinks or grows automatically
 - Snapshots, replication, low-cost, compression and data de-duplication
 - Point-in-time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)

 - Amazon FSx for OpenZFS:
 - Managed OpenZFS file system on AWS
 - Move workloads running on ZFS to AWS
 - File system compatible with NFS (v3, v4; v4.1, v4.2)
 - Works with:
    1. Linux
    2. Windows
    3. MacOS
    4. VMware cloud on AWS
    5. Amazon Workspaces & AppStream 2.0
    6. Amazon EC2, ECS and EKS
 - Up to 1,000,000 IOPS with < 0.5ms latency
 - Snapshots, compression and low-cost
 - Point-in-time instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)

 - File System Deployment options:
    1. Scratch File System:
       - Temporary storage
       - Data is not replicated (does not persist if file server fails)
       - High burst (6x faster, 200MBps per TiB)
       - Usage: short-term processing, optimize costs
    2. Persistent File System:
       - Long-term storage
       - Data is replicated within the same AZ
       - Replace failed files within minutes
       - Usage: long-term processing, sensitive data
