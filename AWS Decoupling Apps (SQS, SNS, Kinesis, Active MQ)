Introduction to messaging:

 - AWS Integration & Messaging:
 - When we start deploying multiple apps, they will inevitably need to communicate with each other.
 - There are two patterns of app communication:
    1. Synchronous communication:
       - application to application
       - Buying service <---------------> Shipping service
    2. Asynchronous / Event based communication:
       - application to queue to application
       - Buying service -----> Queue -----> Shipping service

 - Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are suddens traffic spikes
 - In case you need to encode 1000 videos but usually it's 10 (this would be a major issue)
 - In such cases, it is much better to decouple the applications using:
    1. SQS: queue model
    2. SNS: pub/sub model
    3. Kinesis: real-time streaming model
 - These services can scale independently from the application
