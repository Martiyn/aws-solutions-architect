Amazon S3

 - Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
 - Amazon S3 is advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage
 - Many websites use Amazon S3 as their backbone
 - Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration
 - Use cases include:
    1. Backup and storage
    2. Disaster recovery
    3. Archive
    4. Hybrid cloud storage (on-prem and cloud)
    5. Application hosting
    6. Data lakes & big data analytics
    7. Software delivery
    8. Static website
 - S3 stores files in "buckets", which can be seen as top-level directories
 - S3 files are viewed as "objects"
 - Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions and all accounts)
 - Buckets are defined at the region level
 - S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
 - Naming convention for buckets:
    1. No uppercase, No underscore
    2. 3-63 characters long
    3. Must not be an IP
    4. Must start with lowercase letter or number
    5. Must not start with the prefix xn--
    6. Must not end with the suffix -s3alias

 - Amazon S3 objects:
 - Objects (files) have a key
 - The key of the object is the full path:
    1. s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt (where my_file.txt is the key)
    2. If you want to nest the file in a path, the path becomes the key e.g.
       - s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt (where my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt is the key)
 - The key is composed of a prefix + object name (per the above, my_folder1/another_folder/ is the prefix)
 - Amazon S3 does not have a concept of "directories" (everything is defined as keys per the above)
 - Keys are very long names that contain slashes ("/"), which resemble paths
 - Object values are the content of the body:
    1. Max object size is 5TB (5000GB)
    2. If uploading more than 5GB, "multi-part upload" must be used
 - Objects can have metadata (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)
 - Objects can have tags (Unicode key / value pair - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle
 - Objects can have a Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
