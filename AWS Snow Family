AWS Snow Family

 - Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data in and out of AWS
 - There are three Data migration variants:
    1. Snowcone
    2. Snowball Edge
    3. Snowmobile
 - For Edge computing variants, there are:
    1. Snowcone
    2. Snowball Edge
 - Data migrations with the snow family are used to speed up the data migration process
 - Data migration via the internet can take a very long time (especially with larger datasets)
 - Additional challenges when migrating data via the internet are:
    1. Limited connectivity
    2. Limited bandwidth
    3. High network cost
    4. Shared bandwidth (can't maximize the line)
    5. Connection stability

 - Snow family are offline hardware devices that you can load your data onto and migrate it without the need for internet.
 - When the data is on the Snow device, it can then be uploaded to AWS and vise versa
 - AWS Snowcone:
    1. Small, portable computing anywhere
    2. rugged & secure, withstands harsh environments
    3. Light (2.1kg)
    4. Snowcone - 8TB of HDD storage
    5. Snowcone SSD - 14 TB of SSD storage
    6. You can use snowcone where Snowball Edge does not fit (tight spaces)
    7. Must provide your own battery and cables
    8. Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use AWS DataSync to send data

 - AWS Snowball Edge:
    1. Used to move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS
    2. Pay per data transfer job
    3. Provide block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage
    4. Alternative to moving data over the network
    5. There is a Snowball Edge Storage optimized, which has:
       - 80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage 
    6. There is also Snowball Edge Compute Optimized:
       - 42 TB of HDD or 28TB NVMe capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
    7. Use cases:
       - large data cloud migrations
       - DC decommission
       - disaster recovery

 - AWS Snowmobile:
    1. AWS Snowmobile is an actual truck (literally a truck)
    2. Can transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)
    3. Each Snowmobile has 100PB of capacity (can use multiple in parallel to reach 1 EB)
    4. High security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
    5. Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB

 - Snow Family - Usage Process (Data migration):
    1. Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
    2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers
    3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
    4. Ship back the device once you are done (goes back to the right AWS facility)
    5. Data will be loaded onto an S3 bucket
    6. Snowball is completely wiped

 - Edge computing:
    1. Process data while it's being created on an edge location
    2. Edge locations could be:
       - A truck on the road
       - A ship in the sea
       - A mining station underground
       - etc...
    3. The above locations may have limited or no internet access and limited to no access to computing power
    4. We can setup a Snowball Edge / Snowcone device to do edge computing
    5. Use cases are:
       - Preprocess data
       - Machine learning at the edge
       - Transcoding media streams
    6. If need be, we can ship back the device back to AWS (like for example, transferring data)

 - Snow family for Edge computing:
    1. Snowcone & Snowcone SSD (smaller):
       - 2 CPUs, 4GB of memory, wired or wireless access
       - USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery
    2. Snowball Edge - Compute optimized:
       - 104 vCPUs, 416 GiB of RAM
       - Optional GPU (useful for video processing or machine learning)
       - 28 TB NVMe or 42 TB HDD usable storage
       - Storage clustering available (up to 16 nodes)

 - NOTE: All devices can run EC2 instances & AWS Lambda functions (using AWS IoT Greengrass)
 - Long-term deployment options (1 and 3 years discounted pricing)
 - AWS OpsHub:
    1. Historically, to use Snow Family devices, you needed a CLI
    2. Now, you can use AWS OpsHub (installable software) to manage your Snow Family device
    3.  OpsHub is used to:
        - Unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices
        - Transferring files
        - Launching and managing instances running on Snow Family devices
        - Monitor device metrics (storage capacity, active instances on the device)
        - Launch compatible AWS services on your devices like:
           1. AWS EC2 instances
           2. AWS DataSync
           3. Network File System

 - IMPORTANT - Solution Architecture: Snowball into Glacier
 - Snowball cannot directly import to Glacier
 - You must use Amazon S3 first, in combination with a lifecycle policy
